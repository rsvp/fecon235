# CONTRIBUTING: Notes on forks and pull requests

We are thrilled that you would like to collaborate on 
this project. Your help is essential.

- If you have modified code in a IPython notebook where 
  there are many embedded images, please clear out all 
  outputs before your commit. (The only exception arises 
  in the case of major releases where we want archival 
  samples of images generated).


## Submitting a pull request

0. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
0. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
0. Make your change, add tests, and make sure the tests still pass.
0. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr]
0. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed.


## Tips regarding pull requests

- Refine tests whenever possible.

- Update documentation as necessary.  

- Keep your change focused. If there are multiple changes that are not
  dependent upon each other, please submit them as separate pull requests.

- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Thanks very much for your consideration. Looking forward to reviewing your
code.
